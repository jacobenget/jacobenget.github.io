<div id="aboutMe">
	<div class="paragraph">
		My name is Jacob Enget, and I am a software engineer that got their career start working in video games around 2008.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My first academic love was math.  But a year and a half after finishing my B.S. in mathematics
		I realized that I wanted a career doing something more social and emotionally creative.  This, combined with my long love affair with
		animation and video games, led me back to school to study computer science.  Since then I've been happily working with computers and
		math together.

	<div class="paragraph">
		This website was originally created to showcase creative and technical projects of mine. My then hope was that it would successfully argue
		that me, a recent college grad, would make a good addition to some serious video game studio out there. And it worked! I was first hired by
		<a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/">id Software</a>, spent few years there, and then joined the folks at <a href="http://www.havok.com/">Havok</a>.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I haven't worked in the video game industry since 2015, and this site hasn't received many updates since, but I still keep it
		around as my public face on the internet (although, the design of the site hasn't changed since 2008, so I appologize to any mobile users out there!)

		Besides the <a href="/demos">demonstrations</a> on this site, you'll also find my <a href="/resume">resume</a> and information on how
		to contact <a href="/contact">me</a>. I hope you enjoy looking around, and it would be great to hear from you!
