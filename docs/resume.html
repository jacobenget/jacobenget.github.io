            Technical lead for Rally Health’s Data Platform, after being promoted from Senior Engineer. Was an integral part of a successful migration
            from a fixed Cloudera cluster to a self-service platform using Databricks driven by Spark ETLs written in Scala and scheduled with Airflow
            atop Kubernetes.

          <div class="subpoints">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Provided technical leadership across all teams under the Data umbrella, leading multiple recurring meetings to address architectural needs,
                gather requirements from stakeholders, and provide guidance on complicated implementation details. Met regularly with Databricks
                representatives to address our platform’s needs. Played a key role in interviewing and mentoring new hires. Drove code standardization and
                code review initiatives.
              </li>
              <li>
                Designed and implemented a universal encryption approach to safeguarding sensitive patient information on our new data platform.
                By restricting permissions and standardizing our methods our devs were freed from switching between 50+ different encryption utilities
                and protected from accidentally exposing sensitive upstream encryption keys.
              </li>
              <li>
                Designed a comprehensive north-star observability solution for our new data platform, leveraging Airflow, Splunk, and Datadog.
                This singular technical vision brought all related requirements under one umbrella, giving us the groundwork and confidence to start
                implementing observability features.
              </li>
              <li>
                Authored a strategy for the urgent migration of 170 ETLs from Spark 2 to Spark 3. This approach allowed for each ETL to make the transition
                to Spark 3 independently, giving the members of our 4 data engineering teams the freedom to tackle the conversion of each ETL on its own,
                resulting in a smooth changeover with no forced interruption in development of other ETL features.
              </li>
              <li>
                Designed and implemented a DSL and related tools to drastically reduce the complexity of transforming arbitrarily nested data in a Spark
                DataFrame, making previously painful and deeply-nested encryption and decryption transformations a breeze.
              </li>
              <li>
                Authored a Python library for retrieving secrets, with an API designed to closely match a similar existing Scala library. Due to its
                ease-of-use and robustness this library was quickly adopted by our central Security team, becoming part of the suite of tools used
                throughout Rally Health.

                Researched and developed an HTML/CSS/JavaScript prototype of our framework, using plugins to interact with our rendering infrastructure and to bind our core C++ logic to the browser's JavaScript environment.
