            Technical lead for Rally Health‚Äôs data platform. Was an integral part of a successful migration from a fixed Cloudera cluster to a self-service platform using Databricks driven by Spark ETLs written in Scala.

          <div class="subpoints">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Provided technical leadership across all teams under Rally‚Äôs data umbrella. Led many recurring meetings to address architectural needs, gather requirements from stakeholders, and provide guidance on complicated implementation details. Met regularly with Databricks representatives to address our platform‚Äôs needs. Played a key role in interviewing and mentoring new hires. Drove code standardization and code review initiatives.
              </li>
              <li>
                Engineered a DSL to drastically reduce the complexity of transforming arbitrarily nested data in a Spark DataFrame, making previously painful and deeply-nested encryption and decryption transformations a breeze.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed a comprehensive north-star observability solution for the new data platform, leveraging Airflow, Splunk, and Datadog. This singular technical vision brought all related requirements together, giving us the groundwork and confidence to start implementing observability features.
              </li>
              <li>
                Designed and implemented a universal encryption approach to safeguarding sensitive patient information on our new data platform. By restricting permissions and standardizing our methods our developers no longer had to choose between 50+ different encryption utilities or worry about accidentally exposing sensitive upstream encryption keys.
              </li>
              <li>
                Devised the strategy for an urgent migration of 170 ETLs from Spark 2 to Spark 3 that allowed each ETL to make the transition independently. This gave our 20 data engineers the freedom to tackle each ETL on its own, resulting in no ‚Äústop-the-world‚Äù coordination or forced interruption in development of other ETL features.
              </li>
              <li>
                Authored a Python library for retrieving secrets that was quickly adopted by our central security team, becoming part of the suite of tools used company-wide, due to its robustness and ease-of-use.

This groundbreaking product, the Verizon Risk Report, was revealed at the 2018 RSA conference to much applause and traction in sales.
              </li>
              <li>
                Turned around a troubled client relationship by building trust and camaraderie, creating a partnership which led to a 10x performance gain on the core component of their Python mortgage document generation application.

              <li>
                Successfully led the reboot of backend development of a home delivery application that was behind schedule and out of sync with client requirements. By investing in a detailed API contract up front and switching to a framework that all developers were comfortable with, we then completed the prototype on time and up to snuff.
