<div id="aboutMe" markdown="1">

My name is Jacob Enget, and I am a software engineer that got their career start working in video games around 2008.

My first academic love was math.  But a year and a half after finishing my B.S. in mathematics
I realized that I wanted a career doing something more social and emotionally creative.  This, combined with my long love affair with
animation and video games, led me back to school to study computer science.  Since then I've been happily working with computers and
math together.

This website was originally created to showcase creative and technical projects of mine. My then hope was that it would successfully argue
that me, a recent college grad, would make a good addition to some serious video game studio out there. And it worked! I was first hired by [id Software](http://www.idsoftware.com/), spent few years there, and then joined the folks at [Havok](http://www.havok.com/).

Since then I've continued to use this site as my public face on the internet, adding new and interesting projects as I complete them (e.g. [here](projects/1-doomWadReader.html) and [here](/projects/2-ticTacToe.html)).
I haven't invested in redesigning this site since its initial creation though, so I appreciate the patience of any modile users out there!

Besides the [projects](/projects) on this site, you'll also find my [resume](/resume) and information on how
to contact [me](/contact). I hope you enjoy looking around, and it would be great to hear from you!
