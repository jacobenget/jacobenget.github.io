# Hi there!

I'm Jacob Enget, and I am thrilled you've taken the time to learn more about me!

Here on my website you'll find personal [projects](/projects) of mine, my [resume](/resume), and information on how
to contact [me](/contact).

# About Me

I am a math and computer nerd, and I believe that good software can change the world.

Technology should be amazing. But oftentimes it's exactly the opposite.
I'm passionate about closing that gap by building software that is intuitive, reliable, and inspiring.

## My Career So Far

I hope this high-level overview paints a picture of where I‚Äôm coming from and what my past experience means to me.

In contrast, you can check out my [resume](/resume) for gritty details on accomplishments of mine that I won't address here.

### Prelude: *An Undercurrent of Math*
My first academic love was math.
Fun with numbers and computation drove my personal interests from a very young age[^1], and before I even knew what was what I had a math degree...
shortly after, I realized I wanted a career doing something more social and emotionally creative.

So I put down the Rubik's cube[^2] and followed my interests in animation and video games to earn a degree in computer science.
Though to this day my mathematical appreciation drives my love for abstract foundations, beauty in symmetry, and solutions where math makes hard things easy!

### Act 1: *Video Games* - 7 years
Shortly after obtaining my second degree, and with much excitement, I joined [id Software](http://www.idsoftware.com/) to work on their suite of tools for building video games.
My efforts contributed to the launch of both [*Rage*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_(video_game)) and [*Doom*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(2016_video_game)).
Later I joined the folks at [Havok](http://www.havok.com/) to build from scratch a platform for content creation tools.

Through my years working in the video game industry I got a first-class lesson on the impact of both performance and software usability on a final product.
I also learned how much I love helping others succeed!

### Act 2: *Expanding My Horizons* - 7 years
Feeling like I was missing something[^3], I left the video game industry to explore the great wide open of the tech world.

I intentionally steered my career to work on a myriad of projects, getting experience in frontend, backend, mobile, embedded development, and enjoying a 4 year groove in data engineering.
I worked both at start-ups and at consulting gigs, experienced the pleasure of customer-facing roles, and developed into a leader as I found particular joy working on big data technologies.

Over those years my perspective and confidence grew, as did my understanding of what makes teams succeed: responsive listening, collaboration, and taking the time to understand a problem fully before committing to a solution.
And the same passion of mine provided persistent direction: my love for building systems that help others achieve their vision.

### Intermission: *Touching Grass* - 2 years
We all learned a lot from COVID, and I was left with a new perspective on life.
When I saw before me the option to spend time with my children while they're small I couldn't pass it up, so I voluntarily stepped out of my job and into a childcare role within my family.

I led canoe camping trips to the wilderness of [BWCA](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/superior/recarea/?recid=84168) with extended family, started up a Dungeons & Dragons club at my kids' school, and taught neighborhood kids how to build games in [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).

My joy of programming was with me too as I participated in [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) (a programmer's retreat), 
became a student of the Rust programming language, 
and explored the WebAssembly ecosystem: porting [Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)) to WASM to run the game in the browser and building a parser of the WASM binary format.

This sabbatical, this selfish gift of time, allowed for investment in myself, my family, and the community around me.

## What's Next for Me

I'm excited to step out of my sabbatical and into an engaging role!

I dream of being in a technical position, surrounded by curious and empowered folks, doing work that enables users to create amazing things.

My optimal arrangement doesn't require any specific industry, company structure, or technology stack[^4].
I'm located in Minneapolis, MN, and don't fancy moving but would be comfortable with remote work.

**Areas Where I Have a Strong Interest**

- WebAssembly[^7]
- Software that faithfully delivers the full power of computers to users
  - Content-creation tools
  - Visual Programming[^5]
  - End-User Programming[^6]
- Addressing the larger problems facing society[^8]: climate change, healthcare access, lack of community
- Programming language design

Thanks again for taking the time to learn more about me. I hope you enjoy looking around this site, and it would be great to hear from you!

### Footnotes

[^1]: Fun fact: I was a [two](https://www.edweek.org/education/news-in-brief/1999/05)-[time](https://web.archive.org/web/20240814230250/https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2000/03/19/5005-digits-of-pi-are-part-of-students-memories/) champion of the ùúã memorization contest at my high school.
[^2]: Fun fact: I'd love to talk your ear off about Rubik's cubes: solving them for speed, solving them while blindfolded, inventing your own solution algorithm from scratch!
[^3]: At this time the video game industry felt siloed. Often I found myself reading about advancements happening elsewhere (e.g. the rise of React and similar front-end technologies) and thinking "They're addressing many of the same problems we're struggling with! Why aren't we paying more attention to solutions invented elsewhere?!"
[^4]: I do, however, really enjoy statically-typed programming languages, due to my preference for doing work that produces systems for others to confidently build upon.
[^5]: But done better, by pairing it with text-based programming, leveraging the usability sweet spots of both approaches (at least this is my dream...when I have a working prototype of this I'll be sharing it)
[^6]: [End-User Programming](https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming/): I'm thrilled I finally learned the phrase for this concept; it encompasses so many of my interests!
[^7]: I believe WebAssembly has a shot at really changing how we build software, and I'm inspired by how well designed and led this effort seems to be. 
[^8]: Admittedly, this list is a bit subjective, and somewhat US-specific.
