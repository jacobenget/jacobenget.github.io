This page allows you to play the game tic-tac-toe, against either an AI opponent or a human opponent that is sitting next to you. To simplify things, X's always go first in the game. 
<br/>
<br/>
I mainly<sup>*</sup> built this because I wanted to test out how well a very generic AI algorithm would work on a game like tic-tac-toe, which has a reasonably small set of possible states
(around 6000, assuming that you're oblivious to rotations and symmetries of the game board, which my AI is).
<br/>
<br/>
My idea was to implement an AI algorithm that was completely blind to the mechanics of the game it was playing, in this case tic-tac-toe.
All I wanted the AI to know during its turn was (1) what distinct actions it could take, and (2) what the result would be when it took those actions.
I wanted it to know nothing concrete about the actions it could take, and when the AI took an action it would learn nothing more than "game ends (with a win, loss, or draw)"
or "opponents turn, and they have these actions available to them".
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the AI would assume a simple model of it opponent's behavior.  It would assume that its opponent would seek an immediate win if that was possible, otherwise the opponent would act randomly.
<br/>
<br/>
With this perspective the AI algorithm can, on its turn, simulate all possible further states of the game and calculate its remaining chances of winning at each state.
Armed with that information the AI then chooses, for its turn, the action that maximizes its remaining chances of winning.  And that's it!
<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to play against this AI below to see what you think.  It's definitely not perfect (e.g. it doesn't see a difference between a 'loss' and a 'draw',
they're both just 'not winning' to it, so it'll sometimes make surprising choices) but I think it demonstrates that with a large working memory and great
processing speed some simplish logic can manifest itself as "intelligence."

Also, you can browse the source code for this game <a href="https://github.com/jacobenget/jacobenget.github.io/tree/main/tic_tac_toe">here</a>.
Specifically, you can see the implementation of the AI algorithm described above in the file <a href="https://github.com/jacobenget/jacobenget.github.io/blob/main/tic_tac_toe/src/main/scala/GameAI.scala">GameAI.scala</a>.

<sup>*</sup> - I also built this as part of an application to the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> in fall 2023!

<script type="module">
    import { Main, GameUIElements } from "/assets/js/demos/ticTacToe/main.js";

    $(document).ready(function() {
        var game = document.getElementById("ticTacToeGame")
        var board = game.querySelector("table.board");
        var newGameButton = game.querySelector("button.newGame");
        var playerXSelect = game.querySelector("select.playerXSelect");
        var playerOSelect = game.querySelector("select.playerOSelect");
        var gameStatus = game.querySelector("div.status");

        var gameElements = new GameUIElements(
            board,
            playerXSelect,
            playerOSelect,
            newGameButton,
            gameStatus
        );
        Main.initializeTicTacToeGame(gameElements);
    });
